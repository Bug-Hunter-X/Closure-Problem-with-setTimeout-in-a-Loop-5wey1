This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript closure problem that occurs when using `setTimeout` within a loop.  The issue stems from the fact that the callback function within `setTimeout` doesn't capture the value of `i` at the time of its creation but rather when it's executed.  This results in all callbacks logging the final value of `i` (which is 10). The solution showcases how to use an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to create a closure that captures the correct value of `i` for each iteration.
